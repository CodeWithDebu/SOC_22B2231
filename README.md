# SOC_22B2231
This project walks you through building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. To get started, download the MNIST dataset (mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv) and place them in the /content/ directory. Install the required packages with pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib. Then, run the provided script, which handles data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The script will also generate plots to visualize the model's accuracy and loss over the training epochs, helping you understand how well the model performs.
